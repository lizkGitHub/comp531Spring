<p>Hi, I'm Zhaokang Li. I'm currently a graduate student in computer science department of Rice University. My interest is web development and recommender systems. In my spare time, I like playing the guitar. I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerstyle_guitar">fingerstyle guitar</a> player. The picture above is a moment of my trip in DaLi, China. It is a memorable trip because it is the last trip with my five roomates in college. We don't know if we will have chance to meet each other again.</p>
<p>My facebook is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/li.zhaokang">Zhaokang Li</a>. There are more interesting things in my life.</p>
